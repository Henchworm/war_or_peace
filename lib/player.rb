#comments: although my project will definitely fall well below expectations,
#a lot really clicked for me late Saturday night and I understand
#the purpose of testing and pry much more clearly now. Thanks for looking
#at it and I'm excited to apply more time and knowledge to the next project,
#now that I can apply tests to my code and understand the structure of these
#projects more fully.
